============== 3. Cygwin License (GPL) =============

What are the licensing terms?

Most of the tools are covered by the GNU GPL, some are public domain, 
and others have a X11 style copyright. To cover the GNU GPL requirements, 
the basic rule is if you give out any binaries, you must also make the 
source available. For the full details, be sure to read the text of the
GNU General Public License (GPL). 

The Cygwin API library found in the winsup subdirectory of the source code
is also covered by the GNU GPL (with exceptions; see below). By default, 
all executables link against this library (and in the process include 
GPL'd Cygwin glue code). This means that unless you modify the tools 
so that compiled executables do not make use of the Cygwin library, your
compiled programs will also have to be free software distributed under
the GPL with source code available to all.

*** NOTE ***

In accordance with section 10 of the GPL, Red Hat permits programs whose sources
are distributed under a license that complies with the Open Source definition to
be linked with libcygwin.a without libcygwin.a itself causing the resulting
program to be covered by the GNU GPL. 

This means that you can port an Open Source(tm) application to cygwin, and
distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of libcygwin.a linked
into it. Note that this does not apply to the cygwin DLL itself. If you
distribute a (possibly modified) version of the DLL you must adhere to the
terms of the GPL, i.e. you must provide sources for the cygwin DLL. 

See http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.html for the precise Open
Source Definition referenced above. 

Red Hat sells a special Cygwin License for customers who are unable to provide
their application in open source code form. For more information, please see:
